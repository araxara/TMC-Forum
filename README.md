# TMC-Forum
Seperate app for accessing Tesla Motors Club Forum using SFSafariViewController

This is equivalent to using Safari to browse https://teslamotorsclub.com, but is a seperate app,
to make it more convenient to launch and keep track of. There is also one setting available, which
allows the changing of the intial webpage that the app launches.
